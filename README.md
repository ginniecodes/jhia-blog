Jhinel Arcaya's portfolio source code, hosted in Github.

### Dependencies

It uses Gulp and gulp-markdown plugin to tasks, and mithril as MVC framework.
You can install it using `npm install`. See details in `package.json` file.

### Installing

 It supports markdown but it doesn't instantly make changes until you run Gulp, so you need to install the dependencies
 and install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp`, maybe you'll need some privileges.
